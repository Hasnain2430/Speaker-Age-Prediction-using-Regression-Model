# Speaker-Age-Prediction-using-Regression-Model
A machine learning project that estimates speaker age from audio recordings using a custom multi-regression model. Acoustic features i.e pitch, formants, intensity are extracted, normalized, and used to train the model. Performance is measured with MSE and RÂ². Applications include voice personalization, targeted ads, and forensic analysis.
